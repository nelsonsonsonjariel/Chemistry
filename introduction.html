<H1><b> pH scale</b></H1>
<font size="5"><p>The pH scale is a number scale 
from 0 to 14 that measures the acidity 
or alkalinity of a solution. It indicates 
whether a substance is acidic, neutral, 
or alkaline. A pH of 7 is neutral, while 
values less than 7 are acidic, and values 
greater than 7 are alkaline.</p>
<p>The pH scale functions by quantifying 
the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+)
 in a solution. A lower pH indicates a higher 
concentration of H+ ions, making the solution 
acidic, and a higher pH indicates a lower 
concentration of H+ ions, making the solution 
alkaline.</p>
<p>Is a logarithmic scale: Each pH unit represents 
a tenfold change in the concentration of H+ ions. 
Used for classifying solutions: It helps 
categorize solutions as acidic, alkaline, or 
neutral. </p>
<p>Important in various fields: The pH scale is 
crucial in chemistry, biochemistry, environmental 
science, and even in understanding the human body's pH 
balance.</p>

<H1>Hypothesis</H1>

<p>If the pH of a substance is tested using pH indicators
 or a pH meter, then acidic substances will have a pH 
value below 7, neutral substances will have a pH of 7, 
and basic (alkaline) substances will have a pH above 7, 
because the pH scale is a reliable tool for determining 
the concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution.
